Tidy Data
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Submitted Sept 7, 2018 by MementoMakoMori
=========================================

All initial data for this project is from UCI Machine Learning Repository, and can be accessed directly from the following link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

=========================================
THE DATA (INPUT)
The initial data files contained the information gathered from the acclerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Thirty subjects each performed six activities while wearing the smartphone: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. Each entry in the dataset contains the following information:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The initial files from UCI do not combine these variables into a single dataset. 
=========================================
THE SCRIPT
run_analysis.R is written to first combine the above variables into one dataset, then to create a new tidy dataset containg the following information:
- Subject Identifier
- Activity Label
- Average for each Mean and Standard Deviation Feature. 

This data is grouped by Subject and Activity.
=========================================
OUTPUT
The final tidy data set generated by this script is named "tidy_data.txt". It is a delimeated data set where the first row is the column names.
This script was written to run in the same folder as the UCI files, i.e. the workspace is "~/UCI HAR Dataset/"
